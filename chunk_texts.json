Introduction The number of elderly people living alone has been continuously growing worldwide. Thisindependencecomeswiththeriskofnotreceivingpromptattentionifanaccidentoccurs. Athird ofthepeopleover65yearsoldsufferonaverageonefallperyear[1],andthisnumbergrowswith age[2]andpreviousfalls, whereaboutonethirddevelopfearoffallingagain[3,4]. Notreceiving attentioninthefirsthouroftheaccidentincreasestheriskofdeathandchronicaffections[5].Thisissue has been widely addressed in recent years with systems that detect falls in elderly people, and generateapromptalertthatcanreducetheconsequencesrelatedtomedicalattentionresponsetime[6]. Thesesystemshaveacceptanceamongtheobjectivepopulationasawaytosupporttheirindependence andreducetheirfearoffalling[7]. Developersoffalldetectionsystemsarecurrentlyfacingseveralchallenges. Independentlyof the acquisition strategy, most works are not tested with the objective population (elderly people), reducingtheiraccuracyinreal-lifeapplications[8]. Moreover,allpublicdatasetsexclusivelycontain datafromyoungadults,makingitdifficulttotestnewproposals[9]. Here,wemakepubliclyavailable a dataset with falls and activities of daily living (ADLs) acquired with a wearable device, and we provideresultsofsomeofthemostcommonlyuseddetectionfeatureswithbothyoungandelderly people. The purpose of this work is to provide a benchmark for other researchers on the fall and movement detection field, and to address two rarely discussed open issues: training with young peoplefeaturesintendedforelderlypeople,andsetting-upalgorithmsformaximumaccuracyinstead ofmaximumsensitivity.

Ambient-basedsensorssuchascamerasareintrusiveanddonotsolvetheproblemfor independentadults,whoarenotconfinedtoclosedspaces. Accordingto[2],upto50%ofthefallsin independentelderlypeopleoccuroutsidethehomepremises. Wearabledevicesofferportabilityas theycanbeusedregardlessoftheuserlocation. Availablewearabledevicesincludesmartphoneapps andself-developedsystems. Inbothcases,thepreferredsensoristhetriaxialaccelerometerbecause ofitslowcost,smallsize,andbecauseitisbuilt-ininalmostallsmartphones[6]. Smartphonesare apopularselectionforauthorsbecausetheyincludearobusthardware,apowerfulprocessor,andthey areeconomicallyaffordable[6,11]. However,thelowcostoftheindividualcomponentsanddesign toolshasencouragedauthorstodeveloptheirownembeddeddevicestoo[13]. Independentlyofthedeviceused,authorshavefacedproblemssuchasenergyconsumption, batterylife,falsepositives(thealarmturnsonwithADL),falsenegatives(thealarmdoesnotturnon withfalls),andusercomfortissues.

Additionally, thesmartphonemaygethitsandfallscausedbymanipulation,orthepersonmayforgetitinatable aftercalling,makingitlessfeasibleforpermanentmonitoring. Newstrategiesforsolvingtheaforementionedproblemsrequiretesting. Itrequiresacquiring datasetswithcommontypesoffallsandADLs. Inthissense, someauthorsanalyzedhowelderly people fall. Back in 1993, authors in [5] performed a wide survey with 704 women over 65 years old. Theyreportedthatmostfallswerecausedbytrips,slipsandlossofbalance. However,theydid notrecorddata. Abouttheconditionsofthefall,in[14],theauthorsfoundthatwomenwerethree times more likely to hit the ground on the hips than men, and that most people fell in a forward directionwith60%ofprevalence. Mostactivitiescurrentlyselectedfortestingalgorithmsarebasedon thesestudies. OncetheselectedADLandfallsaresimulatedandrecorded,therawaccelerationdatamustbe processedandclassified. Authorscommonlyfilterthedata,applyafeatureextraction,andclassify activitiesasfallsorADL.Theliteratureprovidesawidenumberoffeatures(see[9],Table4and[12], Table2forcompletelists). Unfortunately,therearenotworksintheliteraturetestedwithindependent elderly people (see [9], Table 1, and [12], Table 4) and available public datasets were all recorded exclusivelywithyoungadults. In[8],forexample,authorstested13state-of-the-artapproacheswith realelderlypeoplefalls,andtheyfoundthattheperformanceoftheseapproachesseverelydecreased underreal-lifeconditions. However,theydidnotreleasethevalidationdataset,i.e.,otherauthors cannotanalyzewhythosefeaturesreducedtheirperformance,and,moreimportantly,howtosolveit.

Threshold-based classification is still the most widely used strategy for fall detection, as it is less computationally intensive than support vector machines and similar classification algorithms [11]. We analyzed twowidelyusedalternatives: Threshold1(T )whichfollowsmaximumaccuracy,andThreshold2 1 (T )whichmaximizesthesensitivity(falldetectioncapability). Thesensitivity(SE),specificity(SP) 2 andaccuracy(AC)werecomputedasfollows[26]: TP TN SE+SP SE= SP= AC= , (1) TP+FN TN+FP 2 whereTPandTNarethetruepositivesandnegatives;FPandFNthefalsepositivesandnegatives, respectively. The way we computed the accuracy allows using an unbalanced number of ADLs and fall trials in a single test. Validation data was tested with the chosen thresholds following a10-foldcross-validation. Figure 2 shows an example of the preprocessing stage and the computation of feature C 8 for ADL D11 (trying to get-up from a chair and fail—Figure 2a) and fall F05 (trip and fall while jogging—Figure2b),withthresholdT . ThisADLwasselectedbecauseofitshighpeakacceleration. 1 Despitethis,C peakwasaround40%belowthethresholdvalue(Figure2a—bottom). Ontheother 8 hand,featureC farcrossedthethresholdduringfallF05(Figure2b—bottom).

Discussion Research on elderly fall detection lacks public datasets with activities and falls simulated by elderly people. Available datasets have few activities and none include falls from the objective population. Inthispaper,wepresentedandmadepubliclyavailabletheSisFalldataset. Itconsistedof upto34activities(fallsandADLs)thatwereperformedby38participantswithawearabledevice fixedtotheirwaist. OneoftheparticipantswasanelderlypersonthatsimulatedbothADLandfalls. Together with the dataset, we included videos of all simulated activities as an effort to help other researcherstoreplicatethiswork. TheSisFalldatasetcontainsmoreparticipants,typesofactivitiesandrecordingsthananyother publicly available dataset. It consists of 2706 ADL and 1798 falls, including data from 15 healthy independentelderlypersons. Toourknowledge,nopublicdatasetcontainsdatafromelderlypeople, andtheirnumberofrecordingsissmaller(Mobifall: 342ADLsand288falls;TFall: continuousADLs and240falls;DLR:961ADLsand56falls;andProjectGravity: 138ADLsand72falls).

Itisnoteworthythat,despite the large difference among validation sets, our results presented the same trend of [8]. Moreover, whentheclassifiersweretrainedwithelderlypeople,theaccuracywasstilllowerthanwithyoung people. Thesefindingssuggestthat,duetotheoverallhigheraccelerationthatyoungpeopleshow inallactivities,includingADLs,andfallsfromelderlypeople,itiscrucialtoobtainproperresults.

Thisfactisnoteworthy,asmost worksfocusonmaximizingaccuracyinsteadoffavoringfalldetection. Authorsthataddressedthis issueusuallyincludedafalse-alarmbuttonaspartoftheirmethodology[29]. Our dataset may be biased by two facts: (i) all of our falls were simulated (mimicked). Klenketal.[28]statedthatyoungpeopletendtofallfasterthaninreal-lifeconditions;(ii)weonly includedfallsfromoneindependentelderlyperson;and,asamartialartsexpert,thissubjectisnot representative of the population. With respect to the first fact, the results of Section 4.2 show that trainingwithyoungpeopleeffectivelyshowshigheraccelerations. However,thisdifferencecanbe quantifiedandcorrectedbycomparingtheirmeanaccelerationperactivityversustheelderlysubjects onthesamedataset. Aboutthesecondfact,ourfallsfromanelderlyperson(Section4.2)presented thesametrendofapreviousworkthatincludedrealfallsofimpairedelderlypeople[8]. However, thecrucialpointherearetheproblemswithobtainingrealfallsfromhealthyindependentelderly people.

The significantly smaller model size and faster inference time of XGBoost reduce memory footprint and computational load, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained wearable devices where battery life and responsiveness are critical. These advantages enhance the feasibility of continuous, real-time monitoring in practical settings. These findings set the stage for further discussion on practical implications and future work. V. CONCLUSION This study presents a robust, multi-stage signal processing pipeline that enables reliable extraction of velocity-based fea- tures from IMU data for wearable fall detection systems.

Vertical velocity features emerged as the most predictive indicators of falls, underscoring their value in distinguishing falls from activities of daily living. The proposed methodology is generalizable and can be integrated into real-time wearable systems, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable fall detection in practical settings. Future work will focus on validating the pipeline across diverse sensor placements, expanding to larger and more heterogeneous populations, and exploring integration with deep learning frameworks for end-to-end optimization.
